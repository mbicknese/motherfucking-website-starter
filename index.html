		<h2>Do whatever the fuck you want</h2>
		<p>
			Just use HTML as it is intended to be used. Look up "new" cool HTML5 features to make it semantic too.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can even throw the HTML files on a webserver you already have. That's how servers work, they serve
			your files. Heck, even throw in a picture, that will work just as well. Gives you a chance to use that
			neat <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture">&lt;picture /&gt;</a>
			element.
		</p>

		<h2>Fucking faster than all other frameworks</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Vue</strong>; that motherfucker doesn't even get close.</li>
			<li><strong>Rollup</strong>; fast build times, we don't have fucking build times.</li>
			<li><strong>Preact</strong>; this fucking website is downloaded before JavaScript can even start.</li>
			<li><strong>[but what about?]</strong>; forget it, this website is faster.</li>
		</ul>
